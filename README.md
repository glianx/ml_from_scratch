Machine learning without libraries.

KNN is 100% own code. Written from mathematical algorithm.

K-Nearest Neighbours uses the Euclidean distance between data points to classify information.

NN is 50% own code. Wrote most data processing. Network based on ML Mastery tutorial.

Neural networks use hidden layers and the backpropagation algorithm to adjust weights and biases in order to learn patterns from a dataset.
